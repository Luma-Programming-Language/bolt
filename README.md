# Bolt

Bolt works by building through scripts.

The goal to to allow for complex building requirements (Ecosystem, conditionals, events).

Bolt is essientally another language. Works similar to Premake.

## You *can* use scripts for everything.
1. Setting up project templates for your framework.
2. Setting up how a project should build based on archetecture.
3. Setting what server to request packages from, should a package be checked, when and how? (solves problems with packages becoming vulnerable).

# Final note
The goal is to provide a simple way of building that can become complex as long as a requirement requires that complexity
